Python Project:-Expense Splitter
#Group Number 12

Objective: The goal of this Expense Splitter is to help users divide shared expenses fairly among a group of people. The program will:

1.Accept details of expenses (amount, participants, and description). 2.Split the total amount equally or by custom amounts between participants. 3.Track the total expenses for each person.

How It Was Done: 1.Adding Expenses: Users can input the expense amount, description, and the participants who share the expense. 2.Split Expenses: Expenses are divided equally, or optionally, custom amounts can be entered. 3.Summary Report: A summary is provided showing how much each person owes or is owed.

Outcome: 1.The Expense Splitter tracks who owes what, based on shared expenses. 2.The user can add as many expenses as needed, and the system will update the balance for eachÂ participant.
